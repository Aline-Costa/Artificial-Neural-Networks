<h4> Single Layer Neural Network </h4>

<ul>
    <li> perceptron to represent the logical AND/OR </li>
	<li> weights are initialized to 0.0</li>
	<li> then iteratively apply the perceptron to each training example </li>
	<li> modifying the perceptron weights whenever it misclassifies an example. </li>
	<li> this process is repeated until the perceptron classifies all training examples correctly.</li>
</ul>
